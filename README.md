# TechEventsUK Event Sourcing App

TechEventsUK Event Sourcing App to allow people to easily discover events that match their interests.

The app features over 100 tech conferences that take place online. Their mission last year was to create an online community covering a broad range of technical topics, from AI to mobile developments, to robotics, and more. Today they are looking to expand their list of events including face-to-face experiences available in the UK.
